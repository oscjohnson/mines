Functional specification:
-------------------------

The aim of this project is to create a multiplayer mine sweeper. It should be possible to join existing games and play instantly. There should also be a lobby function where people can join and the host can start the game. To get access to the game, you must log in using for example facebook. 


Technological specification:
----------------------------

We are considering using meteor.js with angular.js. But are not sure of how well they would interact.

We're not sure if angular is necessary in this project because the functionality of meteor seems to suffice for our needs on both client- and serverside.

Meteor provides data storage through MongoDB which we will use so the clients can get their game data.

Authentication will be handled with the use of Facebook OAuth service.

All clients will have the same functionality except the host of a game who will decide when to start a game but this the only thing that makes the host differ from the others.

We are considering using a testing framework like Q-unit, but will do some research before deciding.
